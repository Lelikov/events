# event-booking Service Overview

> **Maturity: EARLY / PRE-PRODUCTION**
>
> This service is a core domain orchestrator for managing booking constraints, chat creation, and meeting URL generation. Audit-v2 (2026-06-11) hardening: idempotent-resume reliability model (no partial-failure orphans), persistent reminder marker, per-participant meeting URLs, AES-GCM chat user ids. See `docs/AUDIT.md`.

## Domain

Booking orchestration and enrichment service. Consumes booking lifecycle events from RabbitMQ, applies constraint validation, creates GetStream chat channels, generates Jitsi meeting URLs (JWT-signed), shortens the URLs via Shortify, and publishes notifications. Also maintains a background reminder scheduler to emit booking.reminder_sent events.

## Request Flow

```
RabbitMQ topic exchange ("events")
  queue: events.booking.lifecycle.booking (own queue; event-saver has events.booking.lifecycle.saver)
  binding key: events.booking.lifecycle
        |
        v
BookingConsumer                           (consumer.py:25-80)
  - parses CloudEvent (cloudevents-sdk from_http)
  - extracts booking_uid, event_type, and additional data
  - dispatches to BookingController based on event type
        |
        ▼ (booking.created, booking.rescheduled, booking.reassigned, booking.cancelled)
BookingController                         (controllers/booking.py:24-150)
  - [booking.created] Check constraints, create chat, generate meeting URLs, notify
  - [booking.rescheduled] Update meeting URLs, notify
  - [booking.reassigned] Recreate chat, regenerate URLs, notify
  - [booking.cancelled] Cleanup chat, publish cancellation audit event

## Responsibilities

- Consume booking lifecycle events from RabbitMQ (`events.booking.lifecycle.booking` queue, bound to routing key `events.booking.lifecycle`)
- Validate bookings against organizational constraints (when enabled)
- Reject bookings that violate constraints; publish `booking.rejected` events
- Create GetStream chat channels for accepted bookings (one channel per booking)
- Generate Jitsi meeting URLs with JWT-signed tokens
- Shorten URLs using Shortify API
- Publish audit events (`meeting.url_created`, `meeting.url_deleted`, `chat.created`, `chat.deleted`)
- Publish notification commands (`notification.send_requested`) to event-notifier
- Run background reminder scheduler: find upcoming bookings and emit `booking.reminder_sent` events
- Read/write Cal.com PostgreSQL database (maintains booking and attendee records)

## NOT Responsible For

- HTTP API (no external API beyond `/health` endpoint)
- User account management (handled by event-users)
- Transactional email sending (handled by event-notifier)
- Database migrations (not yet implemented; schema is pre-created in Cal.com)
- Message publishing to RabbitMQ directly (uses event-receiver via HTTP)

| `chat.created` | event-receiver → `events.notification.delivery` | Audit: GetStream channel created | After successful chat creation |
| `chat.deleted` | event-receiver → `events.notification.delivery` | Audit: GetStream channel deleted | On booking cancellation |
| `booking.rejected` | event-receiver → `events.booking.lifecycle` | Booking constraint violation | When constraints enabled and violation detected |
| `notification.send_requested` | event-receiver → `events.notification.commands` | Notify client/organizer | On booking created/rescheduled/reassigned/cancelled and reminder triggers |
| `booking.reminder_sent` | event-receiver → `events.booking.lifecycle` | Audit: reminder was triggered | From background scheduler (55-65 min before start) |

Reference: `controllers/booking.py`, `adapters/events.py`

### Booking Lifecycle in event-booking

1. **booking.created** event arrives
   - Load booking details from Cal.com database
   - [Optional] Run constraint analysis; reject if violation
   - Create GetStream chat channel (one per booking)
   - Generate Jitsi JWT + meeting URL
   - Shorten URL via Shortify
   - Publish `meeting.url_created` and `chat.created` audit events
   - Publish `notification.send_requested` to event-notifier (notify both parties)

2. **booking.rescheduled** event arrives (cal.com mints a NEW uid)
   - Delete the OLD uid's chat (from payload `previous_booking_uid`, fallback cal.com `fromReschedule`)
   - Create chat for the new uid (welcome skipped if channel already has messages)
   - MOVE short URLs from the old external ids onto the new uid (shortener update API, create fallback)
   - Write client URL to cal.com `Booking.metadata.videoCallUrl`
   - Publish per-recipient `notification.send_requested` with each recipient's own `meeting_url` and `previous_start_time`

3. **booking.reassigned** event arrives
   - HARD-delete the GetStream channel (soft-deleted channel ids cannot be recreated)
   - Recreate with new organizer; regenerate both participants' URLs in place
   - Publish `chat.deleted`/`chat.created` and per-recipient `notification.send_requested`

4. **booking.cancelled** event arrives
   - Publish per-recipient `notification.send_requested` with cancellation info
   - Delete GetStream chat channel and both short URLs
   - Publish `chat.deleted` and `meeting.url_deleted` audit events

5. **Reminder Scheduler** (background)
   - Polls Cal.com database every N seconds
   - Finds bookings with start_time in [now + 55 min, now + 65 min] WITHOUT the `bookingReminderSentAt` metadata marker
   - Publishes `notification.send_requested` (BOOKING_REMINDER) per booking with deterministic dedupe key, emits `booking.reminder_sent`, then writes the marker

### Reliability Model (idempotent resume)

Every step is idempotent: chat creation returns the existing channel, welcome
messages are skipped when the channel already has messages, short URLs are keyed
by external id, and all follow-up events carry deterministic dedupe ids derived
from the inbound CloudEvent id. Any failure propagates -> the message is rejected
and dead-letters to `events.booking.lifecycle.booking.dlq` (24h TTL) -> a DLQ
replay resumes exactly where the flow stopped without duplicating side effects.

## Known Limitations and Gaps

| Severity | Issue | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| HIGH | No rollback on partial failure | `controllers/booking.py` | Fixed (audit-v2): idempotent resume + DLQ replay |
| HIGH | Reminder scheduler duplicates | `scheduler.py` | Fixed (audit-v2): persistent metadata marker + dedupe keys |
| MEDIUM | Constraint analyzer covers a fixed rule set (active/month/year/interval) only | `controllers/constraints.py` | Open (by design; reschedules are not re-validated) |
| LOW | cal.com schema is external; no Alembic migrations (HARD INVARIANT: never alter or delete cal.com rows beyond status/metadata updates) | `adapters/db.py` | By design |
| LOW | DLQ replay is manual (no automatic retry policy) | `consumer.py` | Open (24h TTL parking lot) |

## Integration Points

### Cal.com PostgreSQL

- **Role:** Primary data store for bookings and attendees
- **Access pattern:** Read booking details on event arrival; update/delete on lifecycle events
- **Schema:** Pre-created (not managed by Alembic); see `adapters/db.py` for table names and columns
- **Failure mode:** If DB unavailable, event processing fails and message is requeued by RabbitMQ

### GetStream Chat API

- **Role:** Create/delete chat channels per booking
- **API:** REST with API key + secret authentication
- **Failure mode:** If GetStream is down, chat creation fails; booking is still processed but client cannot access chat

### Jitsi + Shortify

- **Role:** Generate meeting URLs with JWT tokens; shorten them
- **Jitsi:** JWT-only integration; no direct HTTP connection to Jitsi servers
- **Shortify:** HTTP REST API for URL shortening
- **Failure mode:** If Shortify is down, meeting URL generation fails; event processing may not complete

### event-receiver

- **Role:** Publishes events to RabbitMQ on behalf of event-booking
- **API:** `POST /event/cloudevents` with `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- **Failure mode:** If event-receiver is down, audit/notification events cannot be published; local event processing continues but downstream services miss updates

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests:** Controllers and domain logic (constraints, DTOs)
- **Integration tests:** Database adapter, GetStream client, event publisher (mocked HTTP)
- **Consumer tests:** CloudEvent parsing and event dispatch
- **Scheduler tests:** Background task scheduling and reminder emission
